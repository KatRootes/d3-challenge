# Purpose
Investigate health risks vs demographics (2014) by state by providing an interactive graph.  Three health risks are provided (obese %, smokes %, lacks healthcare %) and three demographics (poverty %, age - median, household income - median).  Users can click on the x-axis labels to select the demographic and the y-axis labels to select the health risks.  A best fit line will overlay the individual state data.  Hover over a state to see details.  Finally, a table below the graph will highlight the current values and provide an r-square for the line fit.
